# Quantum-Randomness 

Hi! I’m **Krish (Quantum-Blade1)**, and this repository showcases my experiments with **Quantum Computing, AI, ML, and Full-Stack Development**.  

Here, I’ve built **fun and educational quantum projects** that use **Qiskit** to demonstrate concepts like **superposition, randomness, and quantum measurement**.

## Projects

### 1. Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)
- Generates truly random numbers using quantum superposition.
- Applies Hadamard gates to qubits and measures them to get random bitstrings.
- **Try it:** `python qrng.py`

### 2. Quantum Coin Flip
- A quantum version of a coin toss (50/50 chance for Heads or Tails).
- Uses **1 qubit in superposition**.
- **Try it:** `python quantum_coin.py`

### 3. Quantum Dice Roll
- Simulates a dice roll using quantum randomness.
- Uses multiple qubits to represent numbers from 1–6.
- **Try it:** `python quantum_dice.py`
